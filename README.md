# Finances Dashboard

This is a basic Plotly Dash app with simple password protection, meant to give me 
a simple look at my finances based off of my transactions pulled from Plaid 
(I have a separate script for that forked from [mbafford/plaid-sync](https://github.com/mbafford/plaid-sync))

If you want to run it locally put your data in `./data` and run `docker-compose up`
